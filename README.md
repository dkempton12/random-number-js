This **randomNumber** function returns a random number between a range of two numbers, using the Math.random function as the default randomNumber parameter.

**Of note**: you tack on (add) the **min** value at the end of the statement in order to shift the range up to the desired range. Otherwise, a range of say (20, 150) would only account for a range of 0 to 130 if the min (20) is not added on.
